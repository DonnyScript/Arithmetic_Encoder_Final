# What is Arithmetic Encoding 
Arithmetic Encoding is a form of entropy encoding used in lossless data compression. It can compress any data into a binary file, which can be restored using a decompression algorithm that mirrors the compression algorithm. Instead of encoding each symbol with a fixed number of bits, it encodes the entire message into one *very* precise number. Our program compresses text from the text bar, and can compress an image of BMP type.
